            <h2>Inventory Control Managment (Lego Database)</h2>
            <div class="pBox">
              <p>We had a client that provided young students with the opportunity to study
                computer science, through a more creative way where they used Lego pieces to
                make robots and using python to program these robots. Our client had a problem
                in the maintenance of the Lego pieces, as it was hard to keep track of it all and
                provide the correct pieces for the correct model, and therefore we have been asked
                by our client to develop such a database which helps to solve this issue. </p>
