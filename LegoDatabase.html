            <h2>Inventory Control Managment (Lego Database)</h2>

        <p>We had a client that provided young students with the opportunity to study <br>
          computer science, through a more creative way where they used Lego pieces to <br>
          make robots and using python to program these robots. Our client had a problem <br>
          in the maintenance of the Lego pieces, as it was hard to keep track of it all and <br>
          provide the correct pieces for the correct model, and therefore we have been asked <br>
          by our client to develop such a database which helps to solve this issue. </p>
