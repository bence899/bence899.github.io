            <h2>Operation and Logisitics Managment (From 9th July 2018 to 13th July 2018)</h2>

        <p>Undertooked a work experience in Bristol learning about the operations
          and technolgies used within their logistics system. </p>
          <p>I have Undertook a week work experience with my co-ordinator at the company
            called ‘Kerry Catherine’. I have been toured around the facilities in Bristol
            where the company mainly focuses on repairing Military engines and Collaborating
            with other companies to build Engines. I had the opportunity to learn the operations
             of how a team communicates when repairing the MTP400 engines and also discovered many
              tools the company uses to handle the important data like delivery of parts handling
              of parts and how they track parts around the company.</p>
