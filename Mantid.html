            <h2>XML Research on the Neutron and Muon Source project (work experience)</h2>

        <p>At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, I was introduced to the Mantid <br>
           Project. This project focused on providing the resources for scientists <br>
           to use high-performance computing and visualisation of materials within <br>
           operating the particle accelerator.<br></p>

        <p>This work experience is one of the UK's seven publicity funded by the government. <br>
          This experience offered me a uniqueness of the diversity of world-leading expertise, <br>
          which drives my knowledge and inspiration towards science & technology forward which <br>
          allowed maximising my impact towards understanding this area. <br></p>

<p>I was shown how the scientist uses these tools and how they are developed. I had the amazing <br>
  opportunity to participate with a group of developers working on the documentation area of the <br>
  project which helped the scientists and PhD students understand how to use the tools correctly.<br>
  The project I was working on for 2 weeks was to document unique sources of both pulsed neutrons and muons <br>
  for exploring properties of matter by measuring the locations of atoms and also documenting how to use the tools <br>
   the mantid project offers where I wrote a guide how to create XML files. This contribution has allowed me to <br>
    make a difference for the first time. <br></p>

          <h3>What I've Leanrt</h3>
          <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>I learnt the importance of why documentation is important when working on any project, as it allows <br>
             clear guidance and understanding for the users the product/service is intended to be used by.</li>
             <hr>
          <li>How to write a step by step guide and really breakdown the entire process for anyone to be able to <br>
             follow these instructions easily.</li>
            <hr>
          <li>Different practices and skills that are necessary for a group when working on a project. Such as methods <br>
             like the waterfall and agile principles. Skills such as time management and organisational skills.</li>
        </ul>
