            <h2>Code Culture (Society)</h2>

        <p>Code Culture was created to provide students with a community where the fundamental skills,
          practices are shared by experienced alumni students and senior students. The society provides
          2 types of programs: </p>

          <h3>Lectures:</h3>
        <p>Mainly discussions held by alumni students giving advice and sharing their experiences of the real world to future generations</p>
