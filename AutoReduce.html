            <h2>AutoReduce Compression (Project)</h2>

        <p>At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Dominic Oram provided me with the <br>
           opportunity to take part in his project which consisted of a team of 30 developers.<br>
           The Project’s aim was to create a system to handle data received by the particle <br>
           accelerators and compress the useful data from it. </p>

        <p>During the Project, I got introduced on how to use Git and GitHub.<br>
           My main responsibility was to analyse some features already implemented <br>
           and improve some features around the backend of the program. <br></p>

        <p>One of the features implemented was the endOfRun.py which checks the <br>
          lastrun.txt every second. However, this was inefficient and I was recommended <br>
          by Dominic to improve this by using a file watcher.  <br> </p>
