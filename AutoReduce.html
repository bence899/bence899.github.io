            <h2>AutoReduce Compression (Project)</h2>
              <div class="pBox">
                <p>At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Dominic Oram provided me with the
                   opportunity to take part in his project which consisted of a team of 30 developers.
                   The Project’s aim was to create a system to handle data received by the particle
                   accelerators and compress the useful data from it. </p>
                 </div>
              <div class="pBox">
                <p>During the Project, I got introduced on how to use Git and GitHub
                   My main responsibility was to analyse some features already implemented
                   and improve some features around the backend of the program.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="pBox">
                 <p>One of the features implemented was the endOfRun.py which checks the
                    lastrun.txt every second. However, this was inefficient and I was recommended
                    by Dominic to improve this by using a file watcher. </p>
